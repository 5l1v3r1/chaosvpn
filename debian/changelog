chaosvpn (2.0~rc9-0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note: starting with this version we receive a different formatted data
    from the central server.
  * Note2: you need to incorporate some changes into your chaosvpn.conf

  * Data on the Server is now signed by a central master key, and then
    encrypted using the public part of our tinc key, and then all
    of this transmitted in one http request.
  * Usage of libcurl has been replaced by a small http get library.
  * In Daemon-Mode config re-fetching has been implemented.
  * Some memory leaks (mostly in error paths) have been fixed.

chaosvpn (2.0~rc8-0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * The major TODO of verifying a signature on the central configfile
    is finished, and lots of more changes.
  * The debian package buildscripts shouldn't need debhelper and quilt
    backports anymore, Lenny is enough.
