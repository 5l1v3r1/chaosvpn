chaosvpn (2.0-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Finally released chaosvpn 2.0
  * Only create meta connections to a selected subset of nodes ("primary")
    when using tinc newer than 1.0.12, less load and tcp connections
    on end nodes.
    This breaks communication with nodes using tinc 1.0.12 and older,
    use config option $connect_only_to_primary_nodes=0 for old method
    of connecting to all non-hidden nodes.
  * New experimental config option $use_dynamic_routes
  * Optional configfile settings to specify VPN network interface name
    and path to tuntap device.
  * Include support to use tinc 1.1-git
  * Some basic compile fixes for FreeBSD

chaosvpn (2.0~rc9-0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note: starting with this version we receive a different formatted data
    from the central server.
  * Note2: you need to incorporate some changes into your chaosvpn.conf

  * Data on the Server is now signed by a central master key, and then
    encrypted using the public part of our tinc key, and then all
    of this transmitted in one http request.
  * Usage of libcurl has been replaced by a small http get library.
  * In Daemon-Mode config re-fetching has been implemented.
  * Some memory leaks (mostly in error paths) have been fixed.

chaosvpn (2.0~rc8-0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * The major TODO of verifying a signature on the central configfile
    is finished, and lots of more changes.
  * The debian package buildscripts shouldn't need debhelper and quilt
    backports anymore, Lenny is enough.
