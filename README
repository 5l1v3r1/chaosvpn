# Introduction

This repository contains the config generator for the ChaosVPN.

It is intended to be small enough for embedded routing devices
which runs OpenWRT as well as standard x86 hardware.

First services which will be available over the ChaosVPN are
the warzone project, the ChaosPhone and the CCC xmpp server.

More information about the ChaosVPN is available at:
    http://chaosvpn.net

We also have a wiki:
