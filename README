This repository contains the config generator for the ChaosVPN. For
information on how to join the ChaosVPN, read INSTALL.

It is intended to be small enough for embedded routing devices
which runs OpenWRT as well as standard x86 hardware.

First services which will be available over the ChaosVPN are
the warzone project, the ChaosPhone and the CCC xmpp server.
