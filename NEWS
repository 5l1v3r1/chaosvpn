== Nov 30th 2010 ==

- Added configuration variable tincd_user.
- tincd_user is now a mandatory setting.
- various small cleanups, including a header file cleanup
- chaosvpn now drops its privileges as well in most situations

Tinc is asked to restrict its right to the ones of that user once it's
done setting up everything it can only set up as root. You must make
sure the user specified with tincd_user has access rights to the
public and private key.
