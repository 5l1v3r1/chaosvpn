Preparation
===========
On Debian you need some packages. Best practice would be use haegars repository:

# echo "deb     http://debian.sdinet.de/ lenny sdinet" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
# echo "deb-src http://debian.sdinet.de/ lenny sdinet" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

Also you need to install the signing key:

# wget -q http://debian.sdinet.de/signkey.asc -O- | apt-key add -

Then you can update the apt cache and install tinc. Tinc has a dependency on
liblzo. So please install it together.

# apt-get update
# apt-get install tinc

As tinc was installed, you have to create the needed folders and the key files
for your machine. In this example, we call the network "chaos" and tinc will
create public and private keys for your machine with 2048 bit.

# mkdir -p /etc/tinc/chaos/hosts
# tincd -n chaos -K 2048

You can save the generated key files on their default location.


Requirements
============
To compile the chaosvpn software, you also need to install some required packages.

* git-core
* make
* bison
* flex
* byacc
* gcc
* g++
* libssl-dev

# apt-get install git-core make bison flex byacc gcc g++ libssl-dev

Please install required dependencies also.


Build ChaosVPN
==============
Now you can clone the chaosvpn source code to your local machine.

# cd /usr/src
# git clone git://github.com/ryd/chaosvpn.git

When finished, you can compile the source code and install it.

# cd chaosvpn
# make
# make install

As the binary was installed on your machine, you have to modify your
local chaosvpn configuration to your needs. The first few lines are
important as it controls the behaviour of your machine.

# vi /etc/tinc/chaosvpn.conf


Publish your details
====================

Now we need some details from your machine to publish it to all
other nodes within the ChaosVPN. You can fill your details into
this template:

----------------------------------------------------------------
# The address where your machine is reachable. leave empty if no
# incoming connections could be made.
gatewayhost=[PUBLIC_STATIC_IP_OR_DYNDNS_HOSTNAME]

# The port number on which your tinc is listening to.
port=4200

# Your name and email address which we can contact in case of
# trouble or issues.
owner="John Doe <jdoe@example.net>"

# The IPv4 network address/es or ranges which your machine is
# responsible for. You can add as many entries as you need.
network=192.0.2.1/32
network=198.51.100.192/28
network=203.0.113.0/24

# The IPv6 network address/es or ranges which your machine is
# responsible for. You can add as many entries as you need.
# Leave empty if your do not have or need IPv6 addresses.
network6=2001:0DB8:1234:5678:0000:0000:0000:0000/64
network6=2001:0DB8:1234:ABCD:0000:0000:0000:0000/64
----------------------------------------------------------------

Now, please send the template to (still haegar or chaosvpn@hamburg.ccc.de???) and attach this file to your email:

* /etc/tinc/chaos/rsa_key.pub

* TODO: crontab for chaosvpn binary
* TODO: running in foreground
